## ðŸŒ± Overview
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is one of the most abundant mRNA modifications in eukaryotes, regulating plant development and stress responses.  
This repository accompanies a **genome-wide study in soybean**, where we identified and characterized **42 m6A regulatory genes** grouped into **writers, erasers, and readers**.  

The analyses cover **phylogeny, gene structures, duplication/evolution, interaction networks, miRNA regulation, and stress-specific expression profiling**.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Findings
- **42 m6A genes** cataloged across writers/erasers/readers with diverse gene architectures.  
- **18 duplication events** detected, evolving mainly under **purifying selection**.  
- **Network analysis** showed weaker interactions among erasers; hub genes identified.  
- **miRNAâ€“gene regulation** stronger on writers compared to erasers/readers.  
- **Stress expression** patterns:  
  - **GmECT9, GmECT13, GmECT17** highly expressed in **roots and nodules**.  
  - **GmMTB2** strongly **upregulated** and **GmALKBH9B2** strongly **downregulated** under combined **drought + heat stress**.  
  - Under **mosaic virus infection**: **GmALKBH9B4** was **downregulated**, while **GmMTB1, GmMTB2, GmALKBH9B1** were **upregulated**.  

This framework provides new insight into the **molecular basis of m6A regulation** in soybean and its relevance to **stress resilience and plant development**.

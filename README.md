In this study, we:

Identified 42 m6A regulatory genes (writers, erasers, readers) in soybean.

Analyzed gene structures, duplication events, and evolutionary patterns.

Constructed interaction networks, highlighting weaker interactions among erasers.

Performed miRNA–gene interaction analysis, showing stronger regulation of writers.

Conducted expression profiling under stress conditions, revealing key regulators (e.g., GmECT9, GmECT13, GmECT17 in roots/nodules; GmMTB2 & GmALKBH9B2 under combined drought–heat stress).

Investigated viral infection response, with distinct up/downregulation patterns.
